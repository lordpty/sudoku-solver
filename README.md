# Sudoku Solver in C

This repository houses a Sudoku solver implemented in the C programming language. The project offers an efficient and elegant solution to solving Sudoku puzzles programmatically.

##Features:

C Implementation: Written entirely in C for optimal performance and portability.
Algorithmic Approach: Utilizes advanced algorithms to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to input Sudoku puzzles for solving or to visualize the step-by-step solving process.

##How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the C source code using your preferred C compiler.
Run the executable, and interact with the user-friendly interface to input or solve Sudoku puzzles.

Sudoku is a 9*9 grid in which each row,each column and each 3*3 grid contains all numbers from 1 to 9 only once.
The program uses backtracking approach to solve the sudoku. There is a recursive function to solve the sudoku.

## Intructions

### How to use:
Use any online compiler------
                                     OR
Use any software with a C compiler.

```sudoku.c``` for a Non-GUI version

args: a to run the solver using optimized algorithm, b for regular backtracking algorithm.
### To modify board:
You can change the board set up by modifying 2D array in my code.
